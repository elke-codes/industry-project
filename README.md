### UX WEB DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION FOR BRAINSTATION INDUSTRY HACKATHON
###### Our team was crowned the winner of the hackathon

This project was made for a 24 hour hackathon during the BrainStation UX and Web Development Bootcamps. 
While being challenged to work cross-discipline for the first time, we were offered a problem by industy partners: 
>"How might we use a digital solution to address the challenges of a post-pandemic world for professionals and businesses in the BC area?"

The UX team came with the following solution:
>"A desktop web app wherein employees can do the following:
○ Play work-appropriate version of social games with ease & earn points
○ Join department or company-wide events
○ Check the leaderboard
○ Shop and redeem points for swag and gift cards"

The Web Development created a MVP of their vision, including a working chat, which you can find here.
